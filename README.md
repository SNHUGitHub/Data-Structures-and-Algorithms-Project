# CS300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Creating a program that allows the advisors of the Computer Science department at ABC University to access course information for students. More specifically, the advisors needed to be able to access the following functionalities from a user menu:
> Load a course data file into the data structure.
> Print course list in alphanumeric order for all the courses in the Computer Science department.
> Search for a user inputted course number and print the course name and any prerequisites for that course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by, first, creating pseudocodes for the different functionalities or classes of the system. More specifically, the pseudocodes were written using three different data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree. This was to compare the time and space efficiency between them in order to determine which data structure was best to implement in the software design. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by reviewing previous lessons and notes, and conducting additional research online for debugging tips and pointers. I also took breaks whenever I felt like I was getting too wrapped up in a logic problem. I have found that these are the times when the solution is usually in front of me, and my mind just needs a break from the whole problem as whole to regain a fresh perspective. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
By introducing me to designing hash tables and binary search trees. This project also introduced me to the concept of the Big-O, and the significance of worst-time complexity and how to determine it. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By keeping in mind the different ways that I can consolidate my program as I code in order to save on memory and running time.
